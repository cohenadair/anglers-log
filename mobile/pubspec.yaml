# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# Read more about versioning at semver.org.
#
# Both numbers must be incremented for Android. DO NOT add any suffix to the date, such as ".2". The
# period will be removed on Google Play and builds with lower numbers cannot be uploaded.

  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: CustomIcons
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/CustomIcons.ttf

    - family: RobotoMedium
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Roboto-Medium.ttf
