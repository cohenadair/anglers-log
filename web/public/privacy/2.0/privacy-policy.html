        <h1>Anglers' Log Privacy Policy</h1>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Anglers' Log ("us", "we", or "our") operates anglerslog.ca, Anglers' Log 
            for Android, and Anglers' Log for iOS (the "App").  This page informs you 
            of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of data we 
            receive from people using the App ("User").
        </p>
        <p>
            By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in
            accordance with this policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            This policy applies to App versions x.y.y, where "x" is any number greater than or 
            equal to 2, and "y" is any number.
        </p>

        <h3>Information Gathered</h3>
        <p>
            The following section describes data gathered by the App, and may not apply to
            external libraries used within the App ("Third Parties").  Please review the
            "Third Parties" section of this document for Privacy Policies on individual Third
            Parties used in the App.
        </p>
        <h4>Fishing Data</h4>
        <p>
            All information ("Data") gathered by the App is stored locally on the device of the 
            User.  Data is neither sent to an online server, nor shared with a Third Party unless 
            authorized by the User.
        </p>
        <h4>Location</h4>
        <p>
            A User's location is used for two reasons:
            <ol>
                <li>To record and save new fishing locations, and</li>
                <li>Gather current weather and atmospheric information.</li>
            </ol>
            The App does not share a User's location with any Third Party; however, Third Parties
            used in the App may explicitly request a User's current location.
        </p>
        <h4>Storage Access</h4>
        <p>
            The App requires access to the User's device storage for two reasons:
            <ol>
                <li>To save photos taken by the App, and</li>
                <li>To attach existing photos to Data.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h4>Network & Internet</h4>
        <p>
            The App does not require a valid network or internet connection to function; however,
            the following features do require a valid network connection:
            <ul>
                <li>Automatic gathering of weather and atmospheric information.</li>
                <li>Data restore and backup.</li>
                <li>Data importing.</li>
                <li>The loading and displaying of the world map.</li>
            </ul>
            In addition, certain Third Parties utilize the internet in order to improve User
            experience. See the "Third Parties" section of this policy for more information.
        </p>

        <h3>Third Parties</h3>
        <h4>Firebase</h4>

            anonymous App usage data.

            <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">here</a>.

        <h4>SendGrid</h4>

        </p>

        <h4>Google Drive</h4>
        <p>
            Google Drive integration within the App allows the User to backup their data to a private folder in their
            Google Drive account. This data is accessible only to the App and is not shared with any Third Party. The 
            App uses the "drive.appdata" scope of the 
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#drive">Google Drive API</a>.
            Please review the App's <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=anglers-log">OAuth Consent Screen</a>,
            and Google Drive's <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.
